## Overview

The GeoLocation Utility lets you input city/state combinations or ZIP codes to retrieve detailed geographical information. You can submit multiple locations at once, and the tool will return the corresponding latitude, longitude, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later)
- A reliable internet connection to access the OpenWeatherMap API.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geolocation-fetcher.git
   cd geolocation-fetcher
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

### Configuration

The application requires an API key to access the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API. For security reasons, the API key should be stored in the `appsettings.json` file.

1. Create an `appsettings.json` file in the root of the project with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "ApiSettings": {
       "OpenWeatherMapApiKey": "your-api-key-here"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Ensure that your `appsettings.json` file is **not** committed to version control by adding it to your `.gitignore` file:

   ```
   # Ignore appsettings file with API keys
   appsettings.json
   ```

3. You can obtain your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Usage

To run the utility, simply use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run -- [location]
```

**Examples**:
- For a city and state:
  ```bash
  dotnet run -- "Madison, WI"
  ```
- For a ZIP code:
  ```bash
  dotnet run -- "10001"
  ```
- To provide multiple locations:
  ```bash
  dotnet run -- "Madison, WI" "10001" "Los Angeles, CA" "Chicago, IL"
  ```

## Testing

To run the tests, use this command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## API Details

This utility uses the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API to retrieve location data. Youâ€™ll need an API key to access this service. While a sample API key is included, it may have limited access, so it's recommended to get your own from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
